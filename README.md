# SoftBodyTest

This is a test project that I wrote to help figure out good values for various variables for the Jellyfier class written using
the tutorial shared on YouTube by Kristin Stock, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxLJ6XewTVs).

The tutorial is super helpful, I encourage you to check it out.
